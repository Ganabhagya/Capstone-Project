Project Tilte: Predicting House Prices in Bangalore

 # Details Of Project
 
 Dataset is downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data
 # Introduction:
In this project, we aim to predict home prices in Bangalore, India, based on various features like the area of the property, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location of the property, etc. The dataset we will be using is collected from the real estate website in Bangalore, India.

# Data Collection:
We have collected the data from the website by scraping the website using Python's BeautifulSoup library. We collected data for more than 10,000 properties in Bangalore, India.

# Data Preprocessing:
After collecting the data, we performed some preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis. The preprocessing steps include removing duplicates, handling missing values, handling outliers, and feature engineering.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
In this step, we analyzed the data to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable (home prices). We used various visualization techniques to understand the distribution of the data, correlation between features, and other insights that might help us in modeling.

# Model Selection:
We experimented with various regression models such as linear regression, Lasso and decision tree regression to find the best model for our data. We evaluated the performance of each model using different performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

# Model Training and Evaluation:
After selecting the best model, we trained the model on the training data and evaluated the model's performance on the test data. We used cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model is not overfitting the data.

# Conclusion:
In this project, we have developed a regression model to predict home prices in Bangalore, India. The model can be used by real estate agents and buyers to estimate the price of a property based on its features. However, it is important to note that the model's accuracy depends on the quality of the data and the features used in the model. Therefore, it is crucial to collect and preprocess the data carefully and choose relevant features to get the best possible results.
